# Final Project


### Project Members: Winnie Hou, Bryan Line, Alex Chau, Kathy Lam
Domain of Interest: Health/Healthcare - Death Caused by Drug Use


## Domain of Interest
- We were interested in this domain because drug use has always been a prevalent
issue in our society.
- We're curious to see if there is any correlation between drug use and natural
death in specific ages, if drug use increases as age increases, and if if the 
number of deaths have increased over the years for the younger population.
