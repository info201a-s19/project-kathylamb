# Final Project

### Project Members: Winnie Hou, Bryan Lin, Alex Chau, Kathy Lam
Domain of Interest: Health/Healthcare - Death Caused by Drug Use

## Domain of Interest
- We were interested in this domain because drug use has always been a prevalent
issue in our society.
- Some examples of data driven projects related to this domain include: 
  - https://ourworldindata.org/alcohol-and-drug-dependency
    - This concise project reveals patterns in drug dependencies around the 
    world and identifies trends in gender and age. 

  - https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/statedeaths.html
    - This project, though simple, gives a brief breakdown of drug overdose 
    deaths throughout the Unites States. 

  - https://ourworldindata.org/substance-use
    - This project utilizes interactive web applications to help people 
    visualize the substance abuse around the world. 

- We're curious to see if there is any **correlation** between drug use and 
natural death in specific ages, if drug use increases as age increases, and if 
the number of deaths have increased over the years for the younger population.
By answering these questions, we believe we can adjust the healthcare approach 
of **addressing and preventing** further deaths by drug use. This problem is 
especially prevalent with individuals presented with high-stress situations who 
rely on an external source to destress or compensate.  

## Finding Data
- Data source URL
  - _Drug Use by Age_ https://data.world/fivethirtyeight/drug-use-by-age
  - _Accidental Drug Related Deaths 2012-2018_ https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/accidental-drug-related-deaths-january-2012-sept-2015
  - _Provisional Drug Overdoes Death Counts_ https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm
  

- Who collected the data?
  - _Drug Use by Age_
    - National Survey on Drug Use and Health from the Substance Abuse and Mental
    Health Data Archive
  - _Accidental Drug Related Deaths 2012-2018_
    - an investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner which 
    includes the toxicity report, death certificate, as well as a scene 
    investigation
  - _Provisional Drug Overdoes Death Counts_
    - National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)


- What is the data about?
  - _Drug Use by Age_
    - A listing of various drug use frequencies associated with various ages 
    from 12 to 65+
  - _Accidental Drug Related Deaths 2012-2018_
    - A listing of each accidental death associated with drug overdoes in 
    Connecticut from 2012-2018
  - _Provisional Drug Overdoes Death Counts_
    - provisional counts for drug overdose deaths based on a current flow of 
    mortality data in the National Vital Statistic System.

- How many observations(rows) were in the data?

  - For the VSRR_Provisional_Drug_Overdose_Death_Counts.csv data, there were 
  13320 rows. For the drug-use-by-age.csv data, there were 17 rows. For the 
  Accidental_Drug_Related_Deaths_2012-2018.csv data, there were 5105 rows.

- How many features(columns) are in the data?

  - For the VSRR_Provisional_Drug_Overdose_Death_Counts.csv data, there were 12 
  columns. For the drug-use-by-age.csv data, there were 28 columns. For the 
  Accidental_Drug_Related_Deaths_2012-2018.csv, there were 41 columns.

- What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
  - Is there a correlation between drug use and natural deaths in certain ages?
  - Does drug use increase as you get older?
  - Has the number of deaths have increased due to drugs over the years in the 
  younger generation?
