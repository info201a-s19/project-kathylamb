# Final Project


### Project Members: Winnie Hou, Bryan Line, Alex Chau, Kathy Lam
Domain of Interest: Health/Healthcare - Death Caused by Drug Use


## Domain of Interest
- We were interested in this domain because drug use has always been a prevalent
issue in our society.
- Some examples of data driven projects related to this domain include: 

> https://data.world/fivethirtyeight/drug-use-by-age

> https://data.world/health/drug-induced-deaths

>https://data.world/samhsa/not-receiving-treatment-drugs

- We're curious to see if there is any correlation between drug use and natural
death in specific ages, if drug use increases as age increases, and if the
number of deaths have increased over the years for the younger population.
